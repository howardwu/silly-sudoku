## Usage

Add `silly-sudoku` to your Leo project:

```

This package is hosted on [Aleo.pm](https://aleo.pm/@howard/silly-sudoku).

## Walkthrough

Start by defining a puzzle grid:
```
[[0, 4, 6],
 [3, 0, 9],
 [7, 5, 0]]
```
We treat all 0's as empty cells in the grid.

Next, generate an answer and construct it as a puzzle grid solution:
```
[[8, 4, 6],
 [3, 1, 9],
 [7, 5, 2]]
```

The SillySudoku circuit will proceed to verify that the solution grid matches the starting puzzle grid,
and check that each number between 1 - 9 is used exactly once.
